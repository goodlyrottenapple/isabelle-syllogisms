# Isabelle/HOL formalisation of simple syllogistic logics

This project is the outcome of a mini summer research project using the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. The .thy files correspond to the sections from lecture notes on syllogistic logics by Larry Moss (http://www.indiana.edu/~iulg/moss/) and they contain the formalised syllogistic logics.

The logic from the first section of the lecture notes has been used to produce a short tutorial on the use of Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.
